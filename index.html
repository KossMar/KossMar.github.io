                <h4>Software Developer</h2>
                    <p>I’m a self-motivated mobile developer, specializing in iOS / Swift. I’m inspired by the multiple
                        languages of the mind that mobile app technology engages, combining my passion for both
                        structure
                        and creativity. I’m enthusiastic about well architectured, tested, quality code and am always
                        looking for new ways to deliver this in my work through new technology and ideas. Attention to
                        detail is important to me. My background in event / project management has sharpened my ability
                        to
                        focus, manage tasks, collaborate with a team and see projects to completion. If I’m not
                        programming,
                        I’m making music, working with electronics or otherwise creating. </p>
